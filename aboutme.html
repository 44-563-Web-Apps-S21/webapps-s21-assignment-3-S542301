            The Blue Ranger is a title given to a character in every Power Rangers series who usually serves as the second-in-command of the team, even though other colors have been known to share the role. While the original Blue Ranger was a serious team member and represented "the smart one", some other subsequent Blue Rangers have been pushed to other positions, such as a comic relief character or a laid-back type of character.
